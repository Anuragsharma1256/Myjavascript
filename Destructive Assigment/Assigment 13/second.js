In JavaScript, there are two main categories of data types: Primitive and non-Primitive.

Primitive data types are immutable and are passed by value. Examples of primitive data types include: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.

Non-primitive data types are mutable and are passed by reference. Examples of non-primitive data types include: object, array, and function.

When using the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript, the value of a primitive data type is copied to the new variable, so changes made to the new variable will not affect the original variable. On the other hand, when a non-primitive data type is assigned to a new variable, a reference to the original data is created, so changes made to the new variable will affect the original variable.

For example:

let num1 = 5;
let num2 = num1; // num2 is assigned the value of num1, which is 5
num2 = 10; // num2 is changed to 10, but num1 remains 5
console.log(num1); // output: 5
console.log(num2); // output: 10
In the above code, num1 is a primitive data type, and when its value is assigned to num2, a copy of the value is made. Therefore, when num2 is changed to 10, num1 remains 5.

When using the equality operator (== or ===) in JavaScript, primitive data types are compared by their value, whereas non-primitive data types are compared by their reference.

For example:


let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr1 == arr2); // output: false
console.log(arr1 === arr2); // output: false
In the above code, arr1 and arr2 are both arrays, which are non-primitive data types. When using the equality operator, JavaScript checks if the two variables reference the same object, which is not the case in this example. Therefore, both the == and === operators return false.
